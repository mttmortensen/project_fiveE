## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Notes
- Reference data like Races, Classes, and Subclasses must be pre-seeded in the DB. Characters reference them by ID.
- POST automatically inserts the related AbilityScores, then ties them back via foreign key.
- PATCH supports any number of partial fields for basic character fields (like HP, XP, name, etc).
